ImageJFind Install Guide
=====================

This guide will help you to set up ImageJFind on your machine.


Prerequisites
-------------

ImageJFind currently depends on a few external libraries.
These are:

 * GTK+ >= 2.8
 * libglade2 >= 2.5.1
 * X11 (specifically libXt)
 * OpenDiamond
 * SnapFind >= 1.1


GTK+ and libglade should be available on any modern Linux system,
as well as X11. Make sure you install the development packages
for your system, which usually end in "-devel" or "-dev".
ImageJFind requires at least version 2.8 of GTK+ and version 2.5.1
of libglade.


OpenDiamond provides the infrastructure for interactive search.

SnapFind is another Diamond application, completely separate from ImageJFind.

SnapFind is needed for just one file, fil_rgb.so. Currently, the easiest
way to build fil_rgb.so is to build SnapFind.

 1. Download Snapfind at
    http://diamond.cs.cmu.edu/packages/snapfind_1.1.0-1.tar.gz

 2. Unpack, and build (not necessary to install) following instructions
    in INSTALL.

 3. Look in snapfind/src/target/lib for fil_rgb.so. You will need this
    later to drop into your build of ImageJFind.



Building ImageJFind
----------------

Once all prerequisites are installed, it's time to build ImageJFind.

 1. ./configure --prefix=[someplace]

 2. make

 3. make -f Makefile.filters

 4. cp [snapfind_build_location]/src/target/lib/fil_rgb.so data/filter

 5. make install

If you have any problems during any step, your prerequisites may not
have been installed correctly.



Configuration Files
-------------------

ImageJFind requires 2 files in "$HOME/.diamond", as described in
the README file in the Diamond distribution. These files are
"gid_map" which maps data repositories to servers, and "name_map"
which maps text names to data repositories.
Search for "Front-end configuration" in Diamond README for details.

ImageJFind currently only searches the first entry in name_map.


Running ImageJFind
---------------

Once everything is set up, you should be able to run ImageJFind.

 1. Start Diamond backends (adiskd).

 2. [prefix]/bin/imagejfind




Good luck!
